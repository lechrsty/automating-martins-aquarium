      <h2>Tips for Keeping Your Aquarium Clean</h2>
    </main>
    <details>
      <summary>Use A Proper Filter</summary>
      <p>The best way to keep an aquarium clean is with a proper filter for the tank's type and size. Opt for the best
        quality filter that fits in your budget, ideally one that uses mechanical, biological and chemical filtration
        for the best combination of cleaning. Check the filter periodically to be sure it is operating correctly, and
        keep it clean to maximize its efficiency. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Change the Water Regularly</summary>
      <p>As water gets dirty it is less attractive and can be unhealthy for your fish. Changing 20-30 percent of the
        water every few weeks can help keep it clear and minimize any dirt accumulation in your tank. Let water stand
        for 48-72 hours before adding it to the tank, however, to be sure chemicals have evaporated and it is safer for
        your fish to acclimate.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Feed Fish Correctly</summary>
      <p>Overfeeding your fish will leave leftover food to decay in the tank, causing algae growth and unsanitary water.
        Uneaten bits of food will also clog filters and clutter the gravel with debris. Feeding your fish higher quality
        food is a better choice, and will also minimize feces and other waste that can make the tank dirty.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Welcome an Algae Eater</summary>
      <p>If your tank grows algae excessively, you can use an algae eater such as a snail or certain species of catfish
        to help control the accumulation. Choose the right eater for your type of algae, and make sure they adjust to
        the tank so they are comfortable and can help nibble your algae problems away.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How to Maintain Salinity</summary>
      <p>To maintain salinity in a saltwater aquarium, you must check the levels regularly. Adding a marine salt mix
        with freshwater when performing water changes will help to keep salinity levels stable. When aquarium water
        level drops, just add water without a marine salt mix otherwise the salinity level will be too high.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Checking the Temperature</summary>
      <p>So you don't boil your fish friends to death, know that most tank fish do well at temperatures from 75-80
        degrees Fahrenheit (23-27 degrees Celsius). However, the needs of specific fish can vary. If your tank is home
        to just one or two types of fish, it is best to investigate their preferred temperature range and take steps to
        keep your tank in the middle of that range.

      Ensure you are covered both above and below water with insurance that explicitly states scuba diving activities are included.

      <summary>Saturn Valley</summary>
      <p>Saturn Valley is a village in Earthbound, located northwest through a cave in Grapefruit Falls. The valley consists of many cylinder-shaped houses and unnecessary ladders. Several odd food items such as the Peanut cheese bar and Piggy Jelly can be found here, which is easy bait to catch-- I mean befriend-- your first Mr. Saturn. </p>
      <p> In the past Mr. Saturns were used to mass produce fly honey, a practice so brutally inhumane that it has been criminalized for the past century. </p>

      <summary>Grapefruit Falls</summary>
      <p>You may have to catch some zombies on your way there, but you can progress through the cemetery in the northwest section of Threed. There will be a ladder descending into an underground area. Once you get through the area below and defeat the Mini-Barf mini-boss, you'll come out into a nice clearing beside a river. Now if you don't go through the entrance to Saturn Valley and continue to the north, you'll find a waterfall known as Grapefruit Falls.</p>
      <p>You need to know the secret password to get behind Grapefruit Falls. The answer is located within Saturn Valley where you'll be introduced to the utterly absurd Mr. Saturns.</p>
