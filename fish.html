  <main><h2>Tips for Keeping Your Aquarium Clean</h2></main>
      <details>
        <summary>Use A Proper Filter</summary>
        <p>The best way to keep an aquarium clean is with a proper filter for the tank's type and size. Opt for the best quality filter that fits in your budget, ideally one that uses mechanical, biological and chemical filtration for the best combination of cleaning. Check the filter periodically to be sure it is operating correctly, and keep it clean to maximize its efficiency. </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Change the Water Regularly</summary>
        <p>As water gets dirty it is less attractive and can be unhealthy for your fish. Changing 20-30 percent of the water every few weeks can help keep it clear and minimize any dirt accumulation in your tank. Let water stand for 48-72 hours before adding it to the tank, however, to be sure chemicals have evaporated and it is safer for your fish to acclimate.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Feed Fish Correctly</summary>
        <p>Overfeeding your fish will leave leftover food to decay in the tank, causing algae growth and unsanitary water. Uneaten bits of food will also clog filters and clutter the gravel with debris. Feeding your fish higher quality food is a better choice, and will also minimize feces and other waste that can make the tank dirty.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Welcome an Algae Eater</summary>
        <p>If your tank grows algae excessively, you can use an algae eater such as a snail or certain species of catfish to help control the accumulation. Choose the right eater for your type of algae, and make sure they adjust to the tank so they are comfortable and can help nibble your algae problems away.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How to Maintain Salinity</summary>
        <p>To maintain salinity in a saltwater aquarium, you must check the levels regularly. Adding a marine salt mix with freshwater when performing water changes will help to keep salinity levels stable. When aquarium water level drops, just add water without a marine salt mix otherwise the salinity level will be too high.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Checking the Temperature</summary>
        <p>So you don't boil your fish friends to death, know that most tank fish do well at temperatures from 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit (23-27 degrees Celsius). However, the needs of specific fish can vary. If your tank is home to just one or two types of fish, it is best to investigate their preferred temperature range and take steps to keep your tank in the middle of that range.
